Topic 1: file cob_fetch_and_carry_demo_sim.launch 
The group discussed the launch file and came up with the following results:
- Verification of this launch file concerning navigation.
- Manipulation: 
   1) planning environment for Jenny: planning_environment.launch in brsu_arm_navigation
   2) environment server for Jenny: environment_server.launch in brsu_arm_navigation
   3) kinematics for Jenny: constraint_aware_kinematics.launch in brsu_arm_navigation
   4) scripts for Jenny: move_arm_joint_goal.py, move_arm_pose_goal.py ???
- Perception have to be added until next lecture/meeting.
- Teena, Alexey and Beate could launch the file successfully. 
-- The kitchen environment was simulated and the robot could be navigated via 
   teleop/keyboard.
-> action item: we agreed to create a new package where the new launch files will be 
   located.

Topic 2: generic state machine (brainstorming)
The group discussed the following three options:
- option 1: creating dummy nodes if needed.
- option 2: using inheritance, if possible.
-- todo: figuring out if some kind of inheritance is available in state machines
- option 3: creating one generic state machine. All robot specific states will 
            be defined in "sub"state machines.
-> action item: no action items agreed.
			
Topic 3: generic script server and other components
- due to time constraints this topic was not discussed
            
Conclusion: Open items will be discussed next Wednesday after lecture.
